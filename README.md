# TimoDir-TRPG-Club.Flex-Responsive

It's an exercise about creating a website for a club. Everything inside is fictional. The purpose of the exercise it's to build a responsive website using CSS.

Maybe I will try to improve it at the end of my cursus to train by using other technologie like React.
